These trees stand just before the first step of the sidewalk, flanking the path beautifully. Their realistic appearance has not only enhanced my home\u2019s curb appeal but also fetched numerous compliments from visitors.The quality of these artificial trees is outstanding. They are well-built and sturdy, designed to withstand various weather conditions without fading, thanks to their UV protection. This durability is crucial for any outdoor decor, as it reduces the need for replacement or excessive maintenance.What I particularly appreciate about these trees is their lifelike appearance. The detailing in the pine needles and the shape of the trees mimic real cedar trees closely, which helps them blend seamlessly with natural landscaping. The pots they come in are also tastefully designed, adding an extra touch of style.Overall, these artificial topiary cedar trees are a fantastic choice for anyone looking to add a touch of greenery without the hassle of upkeep. Their durability and realistic look make them a recommended purchase for enhancing outdoor spaces like patios, porches, or doorways.","purchase_model":"Size: 3FT 2 Pack   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-26 16:11:40"},{"user":"Lisa Perry","content":"These two artificial evergreen plants look amazing on a front porch, patio or deck.They are a good size (approximately 4+ feet tall).They come in two pieces (the top half connects into the center of the bottom half.The limbs/leaves ARE plastic.....NOT silk, so they do have a slight sheen to them when you are up close.From a distance they look completely realistic.They are easy to rinse clean at the water hose.The base is heavily weighted so they don't blow away.They look a lot better if you place them inside of a large flower pot.At Christnas time, they are cut with lights strung around them.","purchase_model":"Size: 4FT 2 Pack   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-06 16:11:40"},{"user":"Juror #8","content":"Another reviewer expressed disappointment at receiving what appeared to be four pieces that were only about 2' high each.Because of the way these are packed, with the bottom potted end on top, it does appear that they are short.HOWEVER, after taking them out of the box, it is clear that they need to be assembled, much like an artificial Christmas tree.Assembly literally consists of sticking the male end of the top into the female end of the bottom.These are every bit as tall as they are supposed to be, if not an inch or two taller.Also much like an artificial Christmas tree, the branches need to be pulled down and \"fluffed\" a little to get a fuller look.The end result is fabulous!I like that these have some weight in the base, but it is nowhere near enough to anchor the trees from any significant wind.I think the weight is a good balance because it is not so heavy that they can't be moved, but it is just enough as a starting weight if you wanted to provide a more permanent \"planted\" set up.I am seriously considering planting that concrete chunk right in the ground.Even up close, these have a very realistic look to them.As I was pulling them out of the box, I had to double check that they were artificial and actually second guessed myself as to what I remembered ordering, vs real trees.Others have commented that they look good from a distance, but I feel they are realistic even up close.I had a specific place to put these when I ordered them, but now that I have them, I am considering placing them somewhere else because they just look that good!The price point appears to be right in line with other similar products.I will be watching these specifically and if I see a coupon or sale, I will jump on purchasing more.While the price may be consistent with others, that is still a lot of money that can be used elsewhere in the current state of the economy.These are definitely a WANT and not a NEED, but when I saw them on Vine, I grabbed them and I am so glad I did.I wholeheartedly recommend these trees and will continue to watch this seller for additional offerings.I couldn't be happier with this selection!","purchase_model":"Size: 4FT 2 Pack   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-16 16:11:40"},{"user":"Rice Krispies","content":"I can't grow a lot of the pretty evergreen or arbor vitae-type trees that thrive in other parts of the country.
