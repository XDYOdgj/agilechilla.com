			var commentsList = [{"user":"Erin Sedalia","content":"These boxwood panels are extremely easy to install on a wall. The edges are thick and easy to connect to each other. Good value for the set!","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 6   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-08 16:11:39"},{"user":"The Crawford Six","content":"These artificial foliage wall panel set has the option of either 6 or 12 (depending which one you want to purchase).I ordered the 6 panels.Not only does it come with the large artificial foliage panels, but they include a pair of gloves (to make it easier on the hands to assemble together), assembling tool & zip ties.These panels are absolutely amazing!They look very life like because the foliage is in multi-tones and some foliage even has multiple gradient shades.The foliage is nice & thick, and they are attached onto the wall panel very tightly. I had not a single foliage piece loose in the box when I opened it.They are very well made.They are attached very sturdy.The foliage pieces do not fall apart or come loose from the backing.In my opinion, these are probably some of the best artificial foliage wall panels I've seen.Quick tip :you can take a crafting heat gun & lightly go through the foliage of each wall panel & work through them with your fingers while using the heat gun about 6-7 inches away from the foliage. This will help spread your foliage pieces out more, making it not so compact.The foliage of your wall panels stand up & come alive & look even more realistic & full than they already are!But, be careful not to overuse the heat gun on them or they will melt & burn.These deserve 10 Stars if I could give that option.Worth every penny & you will not be disappointed!","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 6   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-01-30 16:11:39"},{"user":"Pamela Walker","content":"The South side of my house is very narrow, so I have to be creative to be able to use the space well. I've been able to create semi-private areas by using this grass backdrop on dividers between areas. So, for example, one area has a hammock which is now separate from my deck. It looks natural and fits in well with my living plants.It was easy to assemble and went up quickly. A few of the smaller pieces fell off, but there is enough that it wasn't noticeable overall.","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 6   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-04-19 16:11:39"},{"user":"Kimberley W","content":"What you see in the seller's photos is exactly what you get, which is really how it should be for everything. They are thick, full, and very three-dimensional.At first, I thought they were expensive, but when you break down the cost of each panel, they are $3.33 each. Breakdown: 6 total panels with 4 10x10 squares each panel equals 24 10x10 squares. Then, divided by $80.00, it equals $3.33 for each 10x10 lush panel.They come in a large box with instructions, gloves, long zip ties, and a \"mini assembly tool.\" The tool is supposed to be for reattaching any foliage. I had only a few pieces that needed to be reattached, but I found it easy enough to attach without the tool.The foliage is attached to a very heavy-duty plastic grid, which can be cut if you need a customized shape. There are 4 10x10 squares for each of the six panels that can be separated. There are connectors on each panel that are easy to use and hold firmly. You can use the zip ties for hanging the panels or to reinforce the connectors, although I didn't feel they needed reinforcing.The panels require very little fluffing to accomplish the three-dimensional look. I like that they've already attached 4 of the squares together for each panel because it makes installation so much quicker.They are UV treated so I hope they last forever!","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 6   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-01-26 16:11:39"},{"user":"MC","content":"The panels are exactly as depicted in the seller's photos, being thick, full, and very three-dimensional, which is how all products should be represented. I Had previously bought panels from another seller and they were nothing like pictured. Initially, I found them pricey, but when you calculate the cost per panel, it's reasonable.The package includes a large box with instructions, gloves, long zip ties, and an mini assembly tool for reattaching any loose foliage.The foliage is mounted on a sturdy plastic grid that can be trimmed for custom shapes. Each of the six panels consists of four 10x10 squares, easily separable and equipped with simple-to-use, secure connectors. The zip ties provided can be used for hanging the panels or reinforcing the connectors.Setting up the panels is quick since four squares are already connected per panel, and they require minimal fluffing to achieve the desired three-dimensional effect.","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 6   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-03-06 16:11:39"},{"user":"Signal Sisters","content":"These are quite nice with a good pop of purple colour flowers that look lovely in the sunshine, and variety in foliage. The plastic is thick, and these are fairly densely packed, although they need fluffing and I had to reattach a few in the process. The light will still come through if attached to a trellis or chain link fence, and they look very full on a wall or fence. They are obviously plastic when next to them, but have enough depth and colour variance to look beautiful from a distance, and make a good backdrop for photos (with the right lighting). Everything needed to install these is included. There's a little bit of a plastic smell, but nothing toxic (I am sensitive to that) so also perfect for indoors green walls. I'm installing these (after the rainstorms) on a section of wall where I want a contrast to the boxwood panels we have up outdoors.","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 6   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-02-05 16:11:39"},{"user":"Mariann D","content":"The best thing about these panels is how lush and colorful they are. The aesthetic of these panels supersedes others.I love that they aren't just flat, instead, these panels have volume to them; the faux leaves are of different shapes, sizes, and colors.Even though only six panels came in my order, the 20x20 grid made it seem like I actually got more panels. I was able to cover a pretty big section of my balcony railing.They are easy to connect and install, and it didn't take long at all.","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 6   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-03-10 16:11:39"},{"user":"Luis & Kristen A.","content":"I came across these and thought they'd be great for a decor project in my home and I am not disappointed. These are excellent quality panels. These are all plastic, no silk so they're heavy duty--think artificial plants for an aquarium. The large panel is actually comprised of four smaller panels which seem like they can be taken apart (not sure how easily it'll be though). They're very full so they'd definitely provide cover if that's what you're looking for. The vendor provided clear instructions, some small zipties, a metal attachment tool (?), and a glove to protect your hand while working with the panels which was very considerate. Whether it's for home decor, parties, or a fence, these would be a great choice.","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 6   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-02-08 16:11:39"},{"user":"Vanessa","content":"The Nolruo Artificial Grass Wall Backdrop is a versatile and creative way to enhance your indoor or outdoor decor.
