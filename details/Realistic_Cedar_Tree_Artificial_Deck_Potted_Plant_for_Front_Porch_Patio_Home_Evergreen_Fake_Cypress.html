			var commentsList = [{"user":"Midnite2four","content":"I waited several months to write my review because of course out of the box (where they were nicely packed, btw) they looked really nice, but now after a whole fall season and a few big snows this winter, these cute trees look still brand new. I think they are a good investment if you struggle to keep real trees alive (ants kept making their cities inside my pots and my little trees would alwys die...) Some advice for how to make them sturdy and stay in place: i filled my tall pots with a few bricks and bought a styrofoam circle -like for crafts- I put it inside on top of the bricks. Then I put the fake topiaries and packed it good with river rocks, small pebbles is better so you really put a lot of them and it is heavy. Then I added real soil for the last few inches to make it look natural. So far so good even with somw gusty winds!","purchase_model":"Size: 4FT   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-17 16:11:40"},{"user":"m hass","content":"These are very nice little trees.

They come cemented in their own pot. I'm putting them in large pots on either side of our garage, and they're staying there all year long. Trees look like the real deal. You have options with decorating them. I'm very pleased with these 4-feet trees.","purchase_model":"Size: 4FT   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-23 16:11:40"},{"user":"Texas Shopper","content":"I'm very happy with this matched pair of little pine trees; they are natural looking and quite realistic. They look great with one on either side of an entryway, and they also look nice outside, mixed in with some live potted plants. No one would ever guess they aren't live trees. The foliage looks quite realistic; it is made of plastic, and the plastic's texture works well to mimic the look of real pine branches and needles. The needles, foliage and branches look like they were made from a mold of real tree branches. Each branch has variation of green colors that also add to the realistic look. The trees also have a natural cone shape just like real pine trees, and the three-foot height is rather short, which means so these little tree are versatile -- they could be used as tabletop Christmas trees, holiday porch decorations, or nestled in a corner inside or outside to add a touch of nature.I like that there is no assembly required; all you need to do it take them out of the box and fluff/arrange the branches a bit. Each tree is \"planted\" in a black pot that is quite heavy, filled with concrete to prevent the tree from tipping over. The black pots are nothing special and really meant to be placed inside a more decorative pot of your choosing. I tried them in some gold pots I have and they look nice, although the smaller pot fits the trees better.Overall, this pair of 3-foot tall pine trees are really nice. They are weighted on the bottom to keep them from tipping over, have a natural conical shape, and the foliage is realistic. You can use them inside or outside.","purchase_model":"Size: 3FT   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-04-20 16:11:40"},{"user":"Michael B","content":"Fake porch plants are the way to go. I have a kid and a full-time job. I want my entrance to look nice, but let's be honest I need something that isn't going to die. I actually bought these after seeing my little sisters pair of topiaries last through all of the seasons last year. Her's still look great and so I decided this spring to take the plunge myself. Since these are going into large urns I took out all of the old dirt and filled them with rock. It makes for a heavy stable base that makes it easy to level the topiaries. I then filled around their built-in pots with more rock. This ensures good drainage so I should have no pooling freezing water in the winter and can leave them out year round to decorate for the various seasons.These came packaged nicely to keep the branches from being bent or broken. They have a very good deep green color and the branches are molded so they look very realistic even up close. These are not like those tiny fake Christmas trees that you see out during the winter months. They are also decently priced. It's like buying a real topiary, but you know its fake and you don't have to care for it, and that's worth a lot to me.","purchase_model":"Size: 3FT   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-05-13 16:11:40"},{"user":"Apryl D","content":"When I initially saw one package on the porch I was concerned. Thankfully both topiaries were carefully secured inside. They do require you to spend some time fluffing them to get the full effect. Essentially it\u2019s the same process I do each year with my Christmas tree so it was simple and easy. I did purchase planters to put them in for a nicer look and do highly recommend that to anyone else that gets these. I put white marble rocks in the planters to better stabilize them and it turned out beautifully. I will say that they don\u2019t seem quite as large as depicted but for my purposes they were perfect. They were dense enough to not look cheap or fake until you touch them. I do recommend them and will likely be getting another set for additional decorations on my porch.","purchase_model":"Size: 3FT   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-04-07 16:11:40"},{"user":"Saige","content":"We live in the woods without any streetlights. We have a nice covered porch that is well lit, but it doesn\u2019t have anything but a concrete bench. We decided to get these to add some more greenery to the house. We put them on each side of the concrete bench and they look lovely. We fluffed them up and they have a nice weight to them and they haven\u2019t blown over yet. Very happy with quality and weight.","purchase_model":"Size: 3FT   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-05-03 16:11:40"},{"user":"Lon","content":"I got these to put on my front porch in the spring and summertime because I don\u2019t have much landscaping.

The base is very firm and able to hold these up without much issues or toppling over.They do look fake and the material seems to be made out of some plastic. So they give off a shiny feature.
